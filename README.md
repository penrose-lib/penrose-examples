# Penrose Recipe Examples

These folders show examples of how to use the [Penrose Library](https://github.com/penrose-lib)
to generate version controlled diagrams from your Github repositories. Each top level
folder represents a domain of interest (e.g., Linear Algebra) and the subfolders
within are examples for it. Each subfolder contains:

 1. A file to describe an equation (ending in .sub), and this is called a substance file.
 2. A penrose recipe (ending in .pen) that uses the substance file and references to the Penrose Library to select a style and domain.
